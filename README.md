# Networking Basics

This repository contains solutions and exercises for the Networking Basics project. The project aims to provide a fundamental understanding of computer networks, protocols, and related concepts.

## Description

This project explores essential networking concepts, including the OSI model, types of networks, IP and MAC addresses, and network protocols. Through a series of tasks, you'll gain practical knowledge about how network communications function.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain:

### OSI Model

- What the OSI model is
- The number of layers in the OSI model
- How the OSI model is organized

### Network Types

- What a LAN (Local Area Network) is, its typical usage and geographical size
- What a WAN (Wide Area Network) is, its typical usage and geographical size
- What the Internet is

### Addressing and Protocols

- IP addresses and their types
- What localhost and subnets are
- Why IPv6 was created
- TCP/UDP protocols and their differences
- What ports are and common port numbers (SSH, HTTP, HTTPS)
- Tools used to check network connectivity

## Requirements

### Bash Scripts

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All scripts will run on Ubuntu 22.04
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file at the root of the repository is mandatory
- All scripts must be executable
- Scripts must pass shellcheck without errors
- The first line of all scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`
- The second line should be a comment explaining the script's purpose

### Answer Files

For multiple-choice questions, answer files should contain the number of the correct answer, with one number per line.

## Tasks

1. **OSI Model**: Understanding the Open Systems Interconnection model and its organization
2. **Types of Network**: Identifying different network types (LAN, WAN, Internet)
3. **MAC and IP Address**: Understanding network addressing
4. **UDP and TCP**: Learning about transport protocols
5. **TCP and UDP Ports**: Creating a script to display listening ports
6. **Is the Host on the Network**: Writing a script to ping an IP address

## Resources

- OSI model
- Different types of networks
- LAN and WAN networks
- Internet
- MAC and IP addresses
- TCP/UDP protocols and ports
- ICMP and ping
